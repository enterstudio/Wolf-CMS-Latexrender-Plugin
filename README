A basic pluging which permits the rendering of Latex commands in Wolf 
CMS posts/articles.

In your html code, simply bracket the Latex code within [tex] Code here 
[/tex] and the code is being converted into an image and inserted into 
the post.

In order to make the plugin work, you must filter the content() methods 
of the article classes using an installed static method in the Class 
Latex. Example, in your Layout file, change:

1) <?php echo $content; ?>

into:

2) <?php echo $filtered_content = Latex:latex_content($content); ?>

If you wish to apply the filter to other parts of your Wolf CMS website 
you would have to use the static filter function in the appropriate 
places in the source code.

The plugin folder for this pluging *MUST HAVE* the name 'latexrender', 
so rename after git-cloning.

This plugin is based on the vanilla php code for Latex Rendering 
available at http://www.mayer.dial.pipex.com/tex.htm and has been 
slightly tweaked to work with Wolf CMS. In order for this to work,
you must have Latex, Ghostscript, dvips, ImageMagick installed.
You can further tweak options by accessing the class.LatexRender.php
file.
